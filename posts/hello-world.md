Welcome to my new blog.

After years of writing on Medium and other platforms, I decided to build something simple and owned. No analytics, no cookies, no complexity — just words on a page.

## What to expect

I'll be writing about:

- AI and LLMs — practical insights from building with them daily
- Agentic coding — how AI is changing the way we write software
- Open source — projects I'm working on and lessons learned
- Random thoughts — whatever seems worth sharing

## Why now?

The tools for building on the web have never been simpler. This entire site is just HTML and CSS — no frameworks, no build steps, no dependencies. It loads fast and will work for years.

Sometimes the best technology is the simplest.
